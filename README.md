Here is an expos√© of the labs I have been working on as part of my TSP coursework. I have been designing and implementing comprehensive networking environments utilizing a range of platforms and applications, including Hyper-V and pfSense. Through these labs, I have simulated real-world network infrastructures, configured virtual machines, and enforced security protocols using firewalls and VPNs. This hands-on experience has given me in-depth exposure to virtualization, network management, and troubleshooting, all of which have enhanced my practical understanding of IT environments.
